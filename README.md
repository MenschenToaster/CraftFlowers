# CraftFlowers
craftFlowers is a plugin whose goal is to create custom flowers easier and more efficiently.  
Using an easy-to-use GUI you'll be able to create amazing variants of flowers!  

Use `/craftflowers help` to get a list of all commands.  
You can also use the alias `/cf` for all available commands.   

Since my Plugin utilizes the WorldEdit-API you can also use //undo!  

**Make sure you have a recent version of FastAsyncWorldEdit installed!**

# About the Code

The Developer said that he doesn't have the original Code anymore, so I had to decompile it.

With Version 1.0.0 I have redone almost every line of this plugin.
