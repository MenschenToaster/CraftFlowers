# CraftFlowers
craftFlowers is a plugin whose goal is to create custom flowers easier and more efficiently.  
Using an easy-to-use GUI you'll be able to create amazing variants of flowers!  

Use `/craftflowers help` to get a list of all commands.  
You can also use the alias `/cf` for all available commands.   

Since my Plugin utilizes the WorldEdit-API you can also use //undo!  

**Make sure you have a recent version of FastAsyncWorldEdit installed!**

# About the Code

The Developer said that he doesn't have the original Code anymore so I had to decompile it.  
Look at i-am-allowed.png. I am allowed to do this.  

Most of the Code is the original Code or not properly formatted. Please don't use this to judge my Code-Style ðŸ™ƒ  
The Plugin works for now. If you have any issues please create a Github Issue.
